Quinn Booth's personal website outlining his qualifications and experiences.

This project is heavily focused on learning how to utilize three.js in order to embed javascript applications inside internet pages. Specifically, the goal is to create an interactable 3D environment for the user to explore information in an engaging and unique manner. All the planet and spaceship animations are done using this three.js library. 

The model for the spaceship was done in Blender and imported as a gltf. Additionally, the starting 'click anywhere' text was animated in Blender. Some texturing such as the favicon was completed in Gimp.
